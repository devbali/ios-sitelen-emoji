## How it Works
- This is a keyboard for Toki Pona, a constructed language that only has about 120 words in the entire language
- Sitelen Emoji assigns each word to an Emoji. The emoji set is democratic and changes via referendum frequently.
- Learn more about Sitelen Emoji at the [website](https://sites.google.com/view/sitelenemoji)
- It works similarly to Pinyin, the user enters a toki pona word in the latin script and the keyboard replaces them with emoji

## How to Build
- Clone this repo on your machine (must be a MacOS machine with XCode)
- This should be a valid XCode Project that you can now build

### Why isn't this on the App Store
- I don't know, ever asked Apple why they charge *$100 every year* for an app to be on the App Store?
- I definitely knew that before making the app, and the app was always meant to be released via source code on GitHub
